# Modular Programming Design for Hotel Management System

In the Hotel Management System project, we have several files that handle different functionalities. To ensure a well-organized and modular design, we can structure the files using modular programming principles. Let's take a look at how we can organize the files:

## File Structure

The file structure of our project will look as follows:


Each file focuses on specific functionality and responsibility, allowing for modularity and separation of concerns.

## Module Descriptions

### login.py
The `login.py` module handles user authentication and login functionality. It includes functions to verify user credentials and provide access control to the system.

### main_page.py
The `main_page.py` module contains the main page of the application. It handles the navigation between different features and provides a user-friendly interface for accessing various functionalities.

### customer.py
The `customer.py` module deals with customer-related operations. It includes functions to add new customers, retrieve customer information, and update customer details if necessary.

### booking.py
The `booking.py` module manages hotel bookings. It provides functions to create new bookings, update existing bookings, and retrieve booking details for further processing.

### hotel_expenses.py
The `hotel_expenses.py` module handles hotel-related expenses. It includes functions to manage expenses related to utilities, maintenance, and other financial aspects of running a hotel.

### staff_expenses.py
The `staff_expenses.py` module manages staff-related expenses. It includes functions to handle staff payroll, reimbursements, and other financial matters related to the hotel's staff.

## Benefits of Modular Programming

- **Code Organization:** Modular programming helps in organizing code into separate modules, making it easier to understand and maintain.

- **Reusability:** Each module can be reused in different parts of the application, reducing redundant code and promoting code reuse.

- **Separation of Concerns:** Modules focus on specific functionalities, promoting the separation of concerns and improving code readability.

- **Ease of Testing:** Modular design allows for easier unit testing as each module can be tested independently.

- **Scalability:** As the project grows, modular programming allows for easier expansion and integration of new features.

By adopting a modular programming approach, we ensure a well-structured and maintainable Hotel Management System project.
